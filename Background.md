[What the heck is the event loop anyway? | Philip Roberts |](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)
This is old but gold, I admire this guy because it's an example of several good values. It's great how he had managed to explain easily such a complex concept. Also demonstrating how learning process work for software development, you've something rounding your mind that you don't fully understand and look for several resources for having a better understanding until realising the great disagreement out there about how to explain the node event loop.

Finally decides to fill the gap making a great and funny video that covers deeply and easily how to event loop works under the hood.

[AWS re:Invent 2019: Implementing a data lake on Amazon S3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MzaGFdPfg4)
I'm a fan of AWS re:Invent conferences, I attended the event in live in Madrid in 2018, despite having a comercial intenttion you see some good examples about how people use AWS services and that's it like fresh air for your future projects. I learned what a data lake was in one of these conferences in 2018 and even though is not a topic that I haven't had to develop, I knew what a data lake was and the basis to implement it thanks to AWS re:Invent. The video linked above served me as inspiration for making the architecture analysis of a data lake proposal.

[Really cheap Kubernetes cluster on AWS with kubeadm](https://github.com/cablespaghetti/kubeadm-aws)
I managed to run my own k8s cluster using ECS instances and also collaterally some terraform skills thanks to this repository, for 20$/month I was experimenting and learning with AWS real resources and how to deploy services to a kubernetes cluster, I'm commenting this one because of the number of hours invested on fixing and adapting that terraform code to my needs and because the idea was great, I know that there are other resources like minikube for learning some k8s without having to spend a single dollar but the feeling is not the same than when you use real resources. See https://github.com/borjatur/hapijs-test-service-gitlabci-kubernetes for part of the outcome of this little learning journey, it covers basic CI/CD pipeline with gitlab-ci as well as k8s deployments.

[10 Things I Regret About Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA)
I love this conf because of is unusual to see so level of criticism over something such successful as node is and surprisingly coming from one of its original creators. Basically highlights one common situation which is a developer looking at something that built in the past and talking honestly about the fleaky points that you noticed with the perspective of time. I respect that way of being because it would have been very easy for him just to make conferences talking about how brilliant Node is.
